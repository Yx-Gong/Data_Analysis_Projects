# 1. Packages and Getting Data

#install.packages(c( "XML" , "RSQLite" , "stringr" , "ggplot2","easypackages"  ))

library(easypackages)
# easypackages is for load multiple packages at a time.
libraries("XML","RSQLite","stringr","ggplot2")
# XML package helps to read the HTML data we pull from Web
# RSQLite and stringr are for data manipulation
# ggplot2 is for plotting
